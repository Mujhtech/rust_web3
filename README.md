## Getting Started

I assume anyone going through this tutorial already understands and uses Rust, so I will skip the setup involved in getting Rust to work on your development computer. That means I assume you already have VS Code/Intellij Idea/Eclipse/Atom and Rust setup on your PC.

If you are entirely new to Rust, here ( [https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) ) is a good tutorial you can learn from or make use of online rust playground ( [https://play.rust-lang.org/](https://play.rust-lang.org/) ).


### Run your project
